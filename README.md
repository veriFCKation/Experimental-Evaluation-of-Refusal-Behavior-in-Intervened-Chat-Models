 # Experimental Evaluation of Refusal Behavior in Intervened Chat Models 

This repository  is dedicated for code and other materials related to my work on the thesis. This is the evaluation of changes in the refusal behavior of chat models subject to the white box attack described in the article<sup>[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717)</sup>.
